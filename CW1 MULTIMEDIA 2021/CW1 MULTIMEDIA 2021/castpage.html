  <h1>SHAW</h1>
  <p>SUPREME LEADER KYLO REN</p>
<p>Lucas "The son of Han Solo and Leia Organa, Ben Solo was seduced by the dark side of the Force and renamed himself Kylo Ren: leader of the Knights of Ren, champion of the First Order, and apprentice to Supreme Leader Snoke. Driven to destroy the past, Kylo killed his father and his master, supplanting Snoke as Supreme Leader. But he remained haunted by his father’s death, his connection with the mysterious Rey, and the pull of the good in himself. In time, all three would help Ben Solo return to the light.</p>
<h1>Biography</h1>

<p> Kylo led the attack on the Resistance’s hideout on Crait, but was lured into a confrontation with Luke Skywalker.
  Luke apologized to Kylo for failing him, but warned his nephew that if he struck him down he’d always be with him –
  like Han Solo. Kylo ran Luke through with his blade, only to discover he’d been fooled into fighting a Force projection.
  Meanwhile, Rey had helped Leia and the surviving Resistance members escape Crait.
</p>
<p>As played by actor Adam Driver, Kylo Ren is a hot-tempered supernatural hooligan who torments Finn and Rey,
  the heroes played by John Boyega and Daisy Ridley. In The Force Awakens, Kylo Ren is revealed to be the son
  of Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who turned to the dark side of The Force after
  a poor job of Jedi training by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).
