          <p> RvProductions, The best local digital creator for you! Since i was a child, i have always been up to date with  everyday moments and small happenings in
            my life and assembled the photos chronologically into albums.The albums make up peices
            of how my life was before. From viewing my personal photos i discovered that taking photographs
            was actually not a hobby so i took it a step further with takinga a media course in College in 2010.
            After understanding the conecpts of photography i then tried out videography and enjoyed editing
            videos and pictures in raw format. Purchasing a camera was such a big thing for me when i was younger
            and so i had to re do that excitment moment by purchasing a cannon 500d III. Upgrading from a 800d
            to a 500d iii Was a big step to taking photos and videos professionally. Going through my albums i
            discovered that i was great in taking photos of weddings and also people performing. I used to
            love taking a small disposable camera to weddings and undertaking the job role of a cameraman and for
            me to think that this could be a perfect business line was deffinatelty correct at that very momment
            even if so young. I describe my phtography as honest, intimate, genuine. I love the family joyful
            spirits in concerts and weddings. i approach each and every event/session with fully concentration,
            honesty and loyalty. I put my heart and soul into the work i create and believe
            that it shows in my production i create. .</p>
